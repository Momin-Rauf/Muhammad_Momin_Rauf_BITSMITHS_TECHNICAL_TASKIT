# 🍳 RecipeStudio — Architecture & Design Documentation

RecipeStudio is a modern recipe-sharing platform that allows users to create, share, and interact with cooking recipes. This repository contains the system architecture, database schema, and design plans for building and scaling the application.

## 📌 Task 1 – Requirements & Feature Breakdown

### 📝 Description:
Define core user roles and features for RecipeStudio.

### 👥 User Roles:
- Admin
- Standard User

### ✅ Key Features:
- User authentication & registration (JWT-based)
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Users can:
  - Create, edit, and publish recipes (with optional images)
  - Like, comment, and save recipes to collections
  - Browse feeds based on trending, recency, or likes
  - Search recipes by ingredients, category (vegan, keto, etc.), or cooking time
- Draft & publish states for recipes
- Real-time notifications (likes/comments)
- Admins can:
  - Edit or delete inappropriate content
  - Ban users

### 📄 Deliverables:
- ✅ Feature list & user role matrix (features.md)
- ✅ Optional: Use case diagram / user flow

## 📌 Task 2 – Database Schema Design

### 📝 Description:
Design an efficient and scalable database schema using MongoDB.

### 🗃️ Collections:
- users
- recipes
- comments
- likes
- notifications

### 🔗 Relationships:
- One user → many recipes, likes, comments
- One recipe → many likes, comments
- One notification → senderId, recipientId, recipeId

### 🧠 Indexing:
- Recipes: status, likesCount, createdAt, categories
- Comments: recipeId
- Notifications: recipientId

### 📄 Deliverables:
- ✅ database_schema.md (MongoDB models & indexes)
- ✅ database_schema.png (Visual ERD)

## 📌 Task 3 – Architecture Design

### 📝 Description:
Create the full system architecture for RecipeStudio, with clear data flow and scalability plans.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:

| Layer         | Technology                    |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Frontend      | React.js, Tailwind CSS        |
| Backend       | Node.js, Express.js           |
| Database      | MongoDB + Mongoose            |
| Caching       | Redis                         |
| Media Storage | Cloudinary or AWS S3          |
| Notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging / Pusher |
| Auth          | JWT + Bcrypt                  |

### 🔁 Data Flow Overview:
1. Frontend calls API (login, post recipe, view feed, etc.)
2. Backend processes request and interacts with:
   - MongoDB (data)
   - Cloudinary (image storage)
   - Redis (feed caching)
   - Notification service (likes/comments alerts)

### 📈 Scalability:
- Load balancer + stateless API servers
- Redis caching for trending feed and homepage
- MongoDB Atlas sharding
- Cloud-based image storage (Cloudinary/S3)
- CDN for frontend assets

### 🚀 Performance Optimizations:
- Feed pagination + infinite scroll
- Image compression via Cloudinary
- Lazy loading images
- Debounced search queries
- Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

### 📄 Deliverables:
- ✅ architecture_diagram.png
- ✅ architecture_explanation.txt
